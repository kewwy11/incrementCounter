Made this project using Html, CSS and JavaScript. 
i looped throught the various counter using the forEach method, used the "+" to convert from a string to a variable inorder to add the increments.
Also targeted the innertext of the counter and got the attribute, using the getAttribute function.
Finally used the setTimeout function to increase the value.
